# Configuration

Everything is set from the UI and stored in one file,
`/var/lib/haproxy-manager/config.json` (mode 0600 — it holds the API key, the
session secret, the peers' keys and the password hash). There is **no database**
behind it — no PostgreSQL, no Redis — so that one file is the whole state:
back it up, copy it to new hardware, and you have moved the installation.
HAProxy's and Keepalived's own configuration files are **generated** from it on
Apply; editing them by hand is pointless, because the next Apply overwrites them
(keeping a `.bak`).

## The model

A **service** is the unit you work with: one or more public URLs, a pool of
real servers behind them, and optionally a health check and a certificate.
Publishing one creates the underlying HAProxy objects — a frontend binding, a
host-matching condition, a routing rule, a backend and its servers.

The advanced pages expose those objects directly if you need them. Anything a
published service owns is marked **service** there, and its editor says which
service and warns that publishing that service again rebuilds it. Ownership is
worked out from what the services actually reference, so it stays right even
after objects are edited or rebuilt. Anything the
wizard created is marked as such, and hand-edits to those objects survive: the
wizard updates in place.

Nothing reaches HAProxy until you press **Apply**, which renders the
configuration, validates it with `haproxy -c`, writes it only if valid, and
reloads. A configuration that does not validate is never written.

## Publishing a service

<img src="img/publish-wizard.png" alt="The publish wizard, started from a recipe" width="900">

**Services → Publish a service.** The form is in sections. The first four are
always there; the other five each open with one checkbox and show their
settings only once it is ticked — and an unticked section is off, whatever
its fields still hold.

| Section | Settings |
| --- | --- |
| Service | Public URLs: `https://shop.example.com`, several one per line — they must share a scheme and port — a path (`/api`) routes only that prefix, and `tcp://0.0.0.0:3306` forwards a raw port. Forward to: `10.0.0.5:8080`, or `name=10.0.0.5:8080` to name the server; several make a pool. A name, and whether to apply at once. |
| Certificate | HTTPS only. Reuse an existing one that covers the name (a wildcard included), always request a new one, or none; the ACME account and challenge for a new one; redirect HTTP to HTTPS. |
| Health check | Ticked by default. TCP connect, HTTP request, SSL, PostgreSQL login or MySQL/MariaDB login, with its interval and the check's own settings; a separate check port; logging of up/down changes; *Alert when* — any server lost (default), only a full outage (for pools where one passing server is the design, like Patroni), or never. |
| Balancing and timeouts | Round robin, least connections, source, static round robin or URI hash. Stickiness: none, source-IP (a stick table with its type, size and expiry) or cookie. Connect and server timeouts for this pool. |
| Allowed networks | Off unless ticked. One address or CIDR per line; requests from anywhere else are refused, TCP services included. |
| Rate limiting | Off unless ticked. Requests per client address over a sliding window (10 s unless changed); a client over it gets a 429 (HTTP) or is dropped (TCP) until it slows down. |
| Sign-in | Off unless ticked, HTTPS only. Basic authentication: the groups admitted, the prompt, and the networks that skip it. |
| Single sign-on (OIDC) | Off unless ticked, HTTPS only. The identities allowed, and whether the signed-in email is passed on to the servers. |

### Recipes

The wizard asks for a dozen settings, and for a well-known service there is one
right answer for nearly all of them. **Start from a recipe** fills those in and
leaves the two things only you know: the name to publish and the servers behind
it.

Every one carries example servers, so the shape of the answer is visible before
you replace it with your own.

Recipes are one JSON file each, read when the wizard asks for them — no
restart. The shipped ones live in `static/recipes/` inside the application
directory; put your own in `/var/lib/haproxy-manager/recipes/` (the data
directory), which is where they survive an upgrade — in Docker the
application directory is the image itself, replaced wholesale by the next
pull, while the data directory is the volume. A local file with the same
name as a shipped one replaces it, so a shipped recipe can also be adjusted
without touching the image. A file that is not valid JSON is skipped and the
reason logged, so one bad recipe cannot empty the list. The filename is the
recipe's identity; a minimal one looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "My application",
  "category": "Applications",
  "summary": "What it sets up, in a line.",
  "notes": "Why these settings and not others.",
  "fields": { "url": "https://app.example.com", "target": "10.0.0.10:8080",
              "health": "http", "health_uri": "/healthz", "health_status": "200" }
}
```

The interesting ones are the databases, because the right configuration is not
obvious:

- **Patroni** answers `GET /primary` with 200 on the leader and 503 everywhere
  else, so the health check does the routing. Every replica is simply down for
  that pool, and a failover moves traffic with nothing to change here. Traffic
  goes to 5432 while the check goes to 8008 — different port, different
  protocol.
- **Galera** accepts writes on any node, which is the problem: two nodes writing
  the same rows deadlock on commit. Source stickiness keeps each client on one
  node, so the cluster behaves as a single writer with the others ready.

A recipe is a starting point, not a constraint: every field stays editable, and
recipes are only offered for a new service — applying one to an existing service
would rewrite settings already in use.

**TCP services.** Use `tcp://0.0.0.0:3306` as the public URL and the service is
published in TCP mode — the way to front Galera, PostgreSQL or anything that is
not HTTP.

**Health checks on a different port or protocol.** A Patroni cluster is the
classic case: traffic goes to PostgreSQL on 5432, but the check is an HTTP
request to 8008 that only the leader answers. Set **Check port** and choose an
HTTP check; the rendered backend then checks one place and routes to another.

## Requiring a sign-in

Authentication has [a guide of its own](authentication.md) — it covers all
three doors: this management UI's login (with optional TOTP two-factor),
HTTP basic authentication on published services (users, groups, and the
`userlist` HAProxy checks), and single sign-on through any OpenID Connect
provider (Authentik, Keycloak, Authelia, Pocket ID, Google, Entra), with
per-service allow-lists, identity-header forwarding, the trust model, and
what to do when something refuses.

The short version: manage service accounts under **Sign-in → Users** and
**Groups**; connect a provider under **Sign-in → Single sign-on**; then tick
**Require a sign-in** or **Require single sign-on** on the service — one or
the other, never both. Source-address controls (**Allowed networks**, **Skip
the sign-in from**) compose with either. A sign-in nobody can satisfy
renders as `http-request deny`: refusing everyone is safer than quietly
becoming public.

## Certificates

**Certificates → Request a certificate** walks through an ACME account, a
challenge type and the domains. The accounts, the challenge types and the
issuance settings are all on one page, **Settings → ACME Settings**.

- **HTTP-01** needs port 80 reachable from the internet. The app runs acme.sh's
  standalone listener on 9080 and routes `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` to it
  automatically when "HAProxy integration" is on.
- **DNS-01** needs an API hook and its credentials. The UI lists all 191 hooks
  acme.sh ships with and shows exactly which variables each one needs.
- **Wildcards** require DNS-01. The wizard offers an existing wildcard when it
  covers the name you are publishing, instead of issuing another certificate.

Renewal is automatic and runs **only on the node that holds the virtual IP** —
that node has port 80, so it is the only one that can answer an HTTP-01
challenge. A renewed certificate is deployed, pushed to the other nodes, and
HAProxy is reloaded, without anything to configure.

If acme.sh is missing or broken the Certificates page says so, with the reason.

## The account

The gear beside your name at the foot of the menu opens **Account**: the
username, an email, and the password.

Changing the password or the username asks for the current password — a session
alone is not enough to change how you sign in. The email is not a credential
and there is no reset-by-email here, so it can be set without one. It is
offered as the default when an ACME account is created and when notifications
are set up, so it is only typed once.

**Applying it to the other nodes.** The login is stored per node, so changing
it here changes it only here — and a node with the old password is something
you usually find out about during a failover, at the worst possible moment. So
when the cluster has other nodes, the dialog offers **Apply to the other
nodes**, ticked by default. It sends the stored salt and digest — not the
password — to each node's `/api/admin/receive`, authenticated with that node's
API key. A browser cannot reach that endpoint: a session on the receiving node
is not enough, only the key is. Nodes that do not take it are named, with the
reason, and keep the login they had.

The login is node-local: set it on each node.

**Two-factor authentication** is optional, per administrator, from the same
dialog — standard TOTP with recovery codes; the details, along with the rest
of how signing in works, are in [the authentication guide](authentication.md).
The escape hatch for a lost phone is `app.py disable-2fa` on the node's shell.

## Serving the UI over HTTPS

<img src="img/webui.png" alt="Web UI access: this node's address, the shared address, and which names it answers for" width="900">

**Settings → Web UI access.** Give it a name (`https://proxy.example.com`) and it
publishes this UI as a normal service with a certificate, so you stop using
plain HTTP.

**If the service appears more than once on the Services page**, more than one
rule routes to it — a leftover from a version that could build it twice. Both
send traffic to the same pool, so nothing is broken and nothing is served
twice, but two rows for one service is a puzzle rather than information. Web UI
access names the extras and offers to remove them: the rule this node uses is
kept, the service is rebuilt, and the result applied.

The page says which names this node **actually answers for**, read from the
objects rather than from the setting that made them. The watchdog checks the
same thing every round: if a configured address stops being routed, it rebuilds
the service, applies, and says so in the log and by notification. It does that
at most twice an hour — if the address goes again inside that, something is
actively removing it, and rebuilding on a loop would reload HAProxy every round
while hiding the cause, so it reports and leaves it alone. Those come apart — a name
that was never published, or one that stopped being — and when they do, the
form still shows the address that was typed while the node no longer routes it.
A name listed as not routed here is put back by pressing Save.

Two addresses, and they do different jobs:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **This node's address** | `https://proxy1.example.com` — reaches this node specifically. Node-local: each node has its own. |
| **Shared address** | `https://proxy.example.com` — point it at the virtual IP and it reaches whichever node is active. Shared across the cluster, so every node answers for it. |

Both names sit on one listener, so they must use the same scheme and port, and
the certificate covers both. The shared name is the one to bookmark; the
per-node names are how you reach a specific node when you need to.

This service is deliberately **not editable** on the Services page: each node
builds its own copy from these settings.

Do this early. Over plain HTTP both the password and the session cookie cross
the network in clear.

## Clustering

<img src="img/cluster.png" alt="Cluster settings, shared by every node" width="900">

**Cluster** holds everything about running more than one node.

- **This node** — its URL (how the others reach it) and its API key.
- **Shared settings** — VRID, virtual IPs, authentication, advertisement
  interval. These must match on every node, and they propagate.
- **Per node** — interface, priority, state. These never propagate.
- **Nodes** — the members, their keys and their health.

**Joining.** On a new node choose *Join an existing cluster* and give it any
existing node's URL and API key. It pulls the shared configuration and the
membership list, and tells the others about itself. Unicast peers are derived
from the member list — there is no unicast setting to maintain.

**Only the active node is editable.** Passive nodes are read-only, so two people
cannot edit two nodes into conflict. The lock can be lifted deliberately for a
single session; signing out or in re-locks it.

**Split brain** — more than one node holding the VIP — is detected and reported
on the Overview, and notified if you have notifications configured. It means the
nodes cannot see each other's VRRP.

**Keeping the nodes in step.** The shared configuration carries a revision: a
counter that moves whenever it changes, and a fingerprint of its contents. Both
travel with every push, every node reports them, and the Cluster page shows
which node holds what.

- A node offered a configuration **older** than the one it already has refuses
  it, and says both revisions. Without that, an isolated node that was edited
  and later reconnected would overwrite the current configuration with its own.
- **Overwrite** is how you discard a change made on the wrong node. Editing a
  passive node moves it ahead of the active one, so an ordinary Sync from the
  active node is refused — correctly, because it is older. **Cluster → Other nodes**
  offers *Overwrite* beside each node and *Overwrite every node* below the
  list. It lifts this node's revision above every other node's and then pushes
  normally, so afterwards every node holds the same configuration **and** the
  same revision; nothing is left disagreeing about who is newest. What was on
  the other node is discarded.
- **Keep the nodes in step** (Cluster → Sync) does three things: pushes after
  every Apply, brings any node reporting an older revision up to date in the
  background, and takes the newest configuration from the cluster when this
  node starts. It is on by default for a new installation; an existing one
  keeps whatever it was set to. Turn it off to move configuration between nodes
  by hand.

Reconciliation runs from the node holding the virtual IP, on the health it
already collects, so there is no queue of pending pushes to lose: a push that
fails is simply observed again next round.

**When the nodes do not agree**, the Cluster page lists what differs: the
object, whether it is missing from a node or present everywhere with different
contents, and which nodes hold which version. Settings have no identity of
their own and are compared whole.

The health behind that view is collected in the background and can be up to a
minute old, so anything that changes or pushes the configuration throws the
collected copy away — the next look asks the nodes again rather than repeating
a verdict from before the change.

**What is shared, and what is this node's.** They are separate containers in
the configuration, not one container with some objects marked. The shared
sections hold what every node has; `local` holds what only this node has — and
that includes whole objects, not only settings: the pool, server, health
monitor, rule, conditions and certificate that publish this node's own
management UI.

That makes sharing a copy rather than a filter. What is sent to the other
nodes is the shared sections as they are, and what is compared is the same
value, so the two cannot drift apart. There is no marking to honour and
nothing that has to remember to honour it — which is where four separate
faults came from.

A listener is shared while the rule attaching this node's UI to it is not, so
`local.attach` records that by the listener's **name** (every node has one
called `https-443`, with a different id) and by position — HAProxy takes the
first matching `use_backend`, and serves the first certificate to clients that
send no SNI. Rendering merges the two; nothing else needs to know.

Each node still checks itself after taking a configuration: it compares its own
fingerprint with the one that arrived, and records a mismatch. That should now
be impossible, which is exactly why it is worth reporting if it happens.

**What counts as HAProxy being up.** Keepalived gives the virtual IP up when
its tracking script fails. The default script asks HAProxy through its admin
socket whether it is serving, so an instance that is running but wedged fails
the check; *process* only looks for a process by that name, which a hung one
still has. The script is written next to `keepalived.conf` by the Apply that
writes it, and falls back to looking for the process where there is no admin
socket to ask — a node whose HAProxy is fine should never lose the virtual IP
to the health check itself.

## Addressing nodes

**Use IP addresses for peer URLs, not DNS names.** The Cluster page marks any
peer addressed by name.

Every health check resolves that name again, because nothing caches DNS on a
stock Debian or Ubuntu server: there is no caching resolver installed, and glibc
has none of its own. Measured against a local DNS server, five lookups of one
name produced ten queries (an A and an AAAA each) — none reused. With the
default `timeout:5 attempts:2`, a nameserver that does not answer costs **10
seconds per lookup, every time**, and a failure is precisely the thing no cache
can help with. The name may also be published by the very cluster that is in
trouble.

If you must use names, put them in `/etc/hosts`, or shorten the resolver's
patience with `options timeout:1 attempts:1` in `/etc/resolv.conf`, or install a
caching resolver.

## Watchdog

**Settings → Watchdog.** Each node supervises its own services. The distinction
that matters is between *stopped* and *hung*: `systemctl is-active` reports a
wedged process as healthy, so each service must prove it is answering.

| Service | Probe |
| --- | --- |
| HAProxy | `show info` on its stats socket |
| Keepalived | the service is running when the cluster wants it |
| The app itself | a real HTTP request to its own listener |

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Run the watchdog | on | supervision on this node |
| Supervise HAProxy / Keepalived | on | per service |
| Check every | 20s | one round |
| Restarts allowed per window | 3 | then it stops trying and reports |
| Window | 900s | the window those restarts are counted in |

It will not restart a service whose configuration does not validate (that is a
loop which hides the fault — it reports the offending line instead), nor one you
have masked or disabled, and never more than the budget above.

**Watching the app itself.** A watchdog inside a process cannot restart that
process, so systemd does: the unit sets `WatchdogSec=90`, and the app pings
systemd only when a real request to its own listener succeeds. In Docker there
is no systemd, so a hung manager is reported by the container health check but
not repaired.

**Probe the published URLs** (on by default) asks for every public name once
a minute from the node holding the virtual IP, the way a browser would — DNS,
connection, TLS, request. Failures appear beside the URL on the Services page
and as notifications under the *service* event. A 401 from a sign-in and a
503 from a pool already alerted on are both counted as answering. Turn it off
when the names only resolve from outside your network.

## Notifications

<img src="img/notifications.png" alt="Notification destinations, what they are told about, and recent attempts" width="900">

**Settings → Notifications.** Email (SMTP), Pushover and a JSON webhook. Nothing
extra is installed for any of it.

Alerts fire on **transitions**, not conditions: the watchdog runs every twenty
seconds, so a message per round would be thousands a week. An unresolved problem
is repeated every `repeat_hours` (6 by default) until it clears.

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Only at or above | `error` for breakage only; `warning` adds repairs; `info` adds recoveries and new versions |
| Wait before alerting a service is down | grace period (30s by default) before a service losing servers is reported — a reboot or an update that takes it down for a few seconds is not paged at all. The clock starts when it first goes bad; 0 alerts on the first check. |
| Categories | certificates, watchdog, apply, cluster, updates — each switchable |

Each destination has a **Test** button that sends a real message. Settings are
shared, so configure them on one node and they propagate — which also means
**SMTP passwords and Pushover tokens travel in the sync payload**: run peer sync
over HTTPS, or keep it on a trusted network.

Because every node watches every other, a node that vanishes is reported by each
of its peers.

## Home Assistant

**Settings → Notifications → Home Assistant.** Point it at an MQTT broker and
the entities appear in Home Assistant by MQTT discovery — no YAML on either
side. The settings are shared, like the rest of the notification settings, so
every node reaches the same broker.

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Broker host / port | the MQTT broker Home Assistant already uses (Mosquitto, typically port 1883) |
| Username / password | if the broker requires them; a blank password keeps the stored one |
| TLS | for a broker behind `mqtts://` |
| Discovery prefix | `homeassistant` unless yours was changed |
| Topic prefix | where states are published; `haproxy-manager` by default |
| Allow control from Home Assistant | **off by default** — adds a maintenance switch per service; see below |

Each node publishes its own device (holds the virtual IP, HAProxy answering),
and the node holding the virtual IP publishes the cluster device: a problem
sensor per service honouring its *Alert when* setting, a connectivity sensor
per published URL, days-to-expiry per certificate, configuration drift, nodes
reachable, and requests per minute per service. On failover the new active
node continues the same topics. Availability uses an MQTT will, so entities
grey out the moment a node dies.

**Allow control** adds a switch per service that pauses it — every request
answered with a clean 503 — and resumes it, the same operation as Pause on
the Services page. It is opt-in because the power travels with the broker:
anyone who can publish to the command topics can pause services, so leave it
off unless the broker is behind credentials you trust.

## Upgrades and the browser cache

The page is served with `no-cache`, and everything it loads lives under a path
that contains the version — `/static/v/1.79.0/js/main.js`. Those files are then
cached for a year, which is safe because the URL changes whenever the version
does.

The version has to be in the *path* rather than a query string: each
`import "./shell.js"` inside a module is its own request, resolved relative to
the module that wrote it, so a version in the path is inherited by every import
without touching any of them. After an upgrade a browser fetches the whole set
fresh, and can never hold a mixture of old and new modules.

If you put a caching proxy in front of the UI, let it honour those headers.

## Sorting tables

Every table in the UI sorts: click a heading, click it again to reverse. The
column keeps its arrow so it is clear what the order is.

Values sort by what they mean rather than by how they are spelled — `900 MB`
before `1.2 GB`, `srv9` before `srv10`, `30 mins` before `2 days` — numbers come
before words, blanks stay at the bottom whichever way the column is sorted, and
a totals row stays where it belongs. Pages that refresh on a timer, like
Statistics and Logs, keep the sort you chose instead of resetting it every few
seconds.

## Logs

**Logs** (its own page in the menu) merges four sources into one timeline: the UI's own log,
HAProxy, acme.sh and Keepalived. Filter by source, level and text, and download
exactly what you are looking at.

The app's log is `/var/lib/haproxy-manager/haproxy-manager.log` (mode 0600,
rotated at 4 MB, three kept) and also goes to stdout, so
`journalctl -u haproxy-manager` shows the same lines. Every configuration change
is logged with who made it and from where; request bodies never are, so
passwords and credentials do not reach the log.

### "soft-stop running for too long, performing a hard-stop"

Seen in the HAProxy log after an Apply, followed by a line per listener saying
how many connections it closed:

```
[WARNING] : soft-stop running for too long, performing a hard-stop.
[WARNING] : Proxy fe_https-443 hard-stopped (1 remaining conns will be closed).
[WARNING] : Proxy fe_galera-listener hard-stopped (2 remaining conns will be closed).
```

Nothing is broken. A reload starts a new HAProxy and leaves the old one running
so connections opened before it can finish; **Hard stop after** (Advanced · HAProxy →
Settings, `60s` by default) is how long it waits. When it expires the
old process closes what is left, and says so.

What gets closed is anything longer-lived than that grace period — a database
session, a WebSocket, a stream — so those reconnect on every Apply. The
recipes give such services long server timeouts precisely because their
connections are meant to last, which is why they are the ones that show up
here.

The choice is between two costs:

| Setting | What it costs |
| --- | --- |
| `60s` (default) | long-lived connections are cut on every reload and reconnect |
| something longer | fewer cuts, and old processes hang around that much longer |
| empty | nothing is ever cut, and an old process lingers after every reload for as long as its longest connection — with an hour-long server timeout, potentially an hour, one per reload |

For a database pool, clients reconnect and source stickiness sends them back to
the same node, so the default is usually right. Raise it if a reconnect is
disruptive to what is behind the proxy.

## Traffic history

<img src="img/statistics.png" alt="A day of traffic per pool, with server errors over the requests" width="900">

Each node records, once a minute, how many requests each pool served and how
many server errors it returned, and keeps a day of it in
`$HAM_DATA_DIR/traffic.json`. The Statistics page draws it; the Services page
shows a sparkline per service.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Resolution | one point a minute |
| Kept | 24 hours |
| Scope | this node only |
| Written to | `traffic.json`, never the configuration — it must not move the shared revision |
| Not counted | requests the app makes itself (the URL probes), subtracted per pool at sampling time |

Counts are what happened during that minute, not running totals, and a counter
that has gone backwards is treated as HAProxy having restarted rather than as
negative traffic. Every series carries one value per timestamp, so a pool that
appeared later shows zeros before it existed rather than having its history
slid backwards in time.

## Metrics

`GET /metrics` is Prometheus exposition, guarded by the node's API key sent
as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (or `X-API-Key`). Scrape every node. The
pool counters are HAProxy's own and include the app's URL probes; the
built-in traffic history subtracts them, the raw counters do not.

## Backup and restore

**Settings → Backup & Export** downloads the whole configuration as JSON, and the
rendered `haproxy.cfg` and `keepalived.conf` for inspection.

Restoring replaces the shared objects and keeps node-local settings — the API
key, this node's URL, its Keepalived identity — so a restore does not turn a
node into a copy of another one. Single sign-on settings (the client secret,
the signing secret) are kept as they are on the node rather than replaced, so
a restore never disables SSO. Nothing is applied until you press Apply.

The backup carries no secrets: service password hashes, DNS-provider
credentials, EAB keys and the SSO client secret are all stripped. A restore
onto the same node fills them back from what is stored; a restore elsewhere
leaves them to be entered again. It is safe to copy around.

## Configuration history

**Settings → History.** A snapshot of the shared configuration is kept each
time it changes — the last 50 states, on each node's own disk, in `history/`
under the data directory. Adopting a peer's configuration is snapshotted too,
although it does not move the revision counter: a peer overwriting this
node's configuration is the first thing you would want to undo.

Each entry says what it changed against the one before. **Diff vs now** names
every object between that state and the present one; **Restore** puts the
state back as a new change — next revision, nothing applied or synced until
Apply — and leaves node-local settings alone. The restored state is itself
snapshotted, so a restore can be undone the same way.

## What is shared and what is per node

| Shared (propagates) | Per node (never propagates) |
| --- | --- |
| HAProxy objects: services, pools, servers, rules | API key |
| ACME accounts, challenge types, certificates | This node's URL |
| Cluster VRRP settings: VRID, VIPs, auth, interval | Keepalived interface, priority, state |
| Notification settings and destinations | The UI's own HTTPS service, and its certificate |
| Service sign-in users and groups | Configuration history (each node remembers what it saw) |
| | Administrator login |
| | Watchdog settings |

The UI's own service is the reason the right-hand column matters more than it
looks. Every node publishes it under the same name, for a different host, so
everything it is made of — the pool, the server, the health monitor, the rule,
the conditions it tests and the certificate for that node's own name — belongs
to the node that made it. Anything of that sort left in the shared
configuration travels to the other nodes, where it collides with theirs; the
wizard then makes a numbered copy, which travels in turn, and the cluster never
agrees with itself again.

None of that can happen now: those objects are not in the shared sections at
all, so there is nothing to send. Upgrading moves what was there into place,
once, and the generated `haproxy.cfg` is unchanged by the move apart from where
one `backend` block sits in the file — which HAProxy resolves by name.

## Environment variables

Read by the app at startup. Set them in the unit
(`systemctl edit haproxy-manager`) or the container's environment.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HAM_DATA_DIR` | `/var/lib/haproxy-manager` | config.json and the log |
| `HAM_CERT_DIR` | `/etc/haproxy/certs` | deployed certificate PEMs |
| `HAM_HAPROXY_CFG` | `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` | generated HAProxy config |
| `HAM_KEEPALIVED_CFG` | `/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf` | generated Keepalived config |
| `HAM_ACME_HOME` | `~/.acme.sh` | ACME accounts and issued certificates |
| `HAM_ACME_SH` | `$HAM_ACME_HOME/acme.sh` | the acme.sh executable |
| `HAM_STATS_SOCK` | `/run/haproxy/admin.sock` | HAProxy's admin socket |
| `HAM_LISTEN` | `0.0.0.0` | bind address |
| `HAM_PORT` | `8080` | UI and API port |
| `HAM_THREADS` | `16` | waitress worker threads (single process — see below) |
| `HAM_LOG_FILE` | `$HAM_DATA_DIR/haproxy-manager.log` | the app's log |
| `HAM_DEBUG` | — | `1` for verbose logging |
| `HAM_PEER_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` | `3` | waiting for a node to accept a connection |
| `HAM_PEER_READ_TIMEOUT` | `5` | waiting for it to answer a health query |
| `HAM_PUSH_READ_TIMEOUT` | `90` | waiting for it to accept a pushed configuration |
| `HAM_CLUSTER_POLL` | `15` | how often node health is collected in the background |
| `HAM_CLUSTER_MAX_AGE` | `60` | age at which a stale snapshot is collected inline |
| `HAM_WATCHDOG_PROBE_TIMEOUT` | `5` | how long a service may take to answer its probe |
| `HAM_WATCHDOG_SELF_TIMEOUT` | `10` | how long the app's self-check may take |
| `HAM_REPO` / `HAM_REF` | `invite-networks/haproxy-manager` / `main` | where updates come from |
| `HAM_VERSION_URL` / `HAM_INSTALL_URL` | GitHub | override for a fork or mirror |
| `HAM_DRY_RUN` | — | `1` renders and validates but never reloads services |

**Do not run this behind a multi-process WSGI server.** It is served by waitress
as a single process with a thread pool on purpose: the lock that makes
configuration writes atomic, the failed-sign-in counters and the renewal timer
all live in process memory. Several worker *processes* would each get their own
copy, and concurrent edits would overwrite one another. Raise `HAM_THREADS` if
you need more concurrency.

## Ports

| Port | What | Who needs to reach it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8080 | UI and API | you, and the other nodes (peer sync) |
| 9080 | acme.sh HTTP-01 standalone listener | nothing directly — HAProxy routes to it |
| 80 / 443 | whatever your services bind | your users, and Let's Encrypt for HTTP-01 |
| — | VRRP (protocol 112, multicast or unicast) | the other nodes |

The API key is a bearer token with full control of a node. Restrict who can
reach port 8080, and put the UI behind TLS.
