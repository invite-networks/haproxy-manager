"""The application, split by subject.

app.py is the entry point -- the command line, the background threads and
the server. Everything it serves lives here, one module per subject.

The import rule is worth knowing before changing anything: base, config,
util and validate are foundations and are imported by name. Every other
module addresses its siblings by module (`from . import cluster`, then
`cluster.sync_push(...)`), because feature modules depend on each other in
both directions and a qualified name is what keeps that legal.

Importing this package registers every route on `app`; nothing else here
has an import-time side effect.
