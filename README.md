A small self-hosted web UI to manage an **HAProxy** configuration, obtain
**Let's Encrypt** certificates, and run a **cluster of any number of nodes with
Keepalived** on a shared virtual IP — one node active, the rest ready to take
over, with settings and certificates syncing across all of them.

**No database to run — no PostgreSQL, no Redis, no message broker.** The whole
configuration is one JSON file on disk, and a cluster keeps its nodes in step
by syncing that file between them over HTTPS. There is no separate datastore to
install, secure, tune, back up, or keep alive alongside the proxy — which is
the point: the tool that manages your load balancer should not itself be a
stack that needs managing. A backup is one file; moving to new hardware is
copying it across.

```bash
# from a package: .deb and .rpm on every release (Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, Fedora)
sudo apt-get install -y ./haproxy-manager_1.95.0_all.deb

# or the install script, on any Debian-based server
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invite-networks/haproxy-manager/main/install.sh | sudo bash

# or in Docker (linux/amd64 and linux/arm64)
docker run -d --network host --cap-add NET_ADMIN --cap-add NET_BROADCAST --cap-add NET_RAW \
  -v ham-data:/var/lib/haproxy-manager -v ham-acme:/var/lib/acme.sh \
  -v ham-haproxy:/etc/haproxy -v ham-keepalived:/etc/keepalived \
  ghcr.io/avandeputte/haproxy-manager:latest
```

Then open `http://<node>:8080`.

The rest of this file describes what each part does and why.

## First run

The first visit asks for a username and password, then offers a setup wizard
with two branches:

- **Join an existing cluster** — point it at any node already running and give
  that node's API key. It registers itself there and that node pushes the
  whole configuration, the cluster settings and the membership list back. You do
  not touch the other nodes.
- **Create a new cluster, or run standalone** — set the virtual IP the nodes will
  share (or skip it and run alone). Other nodes join later by pointing at this
  one.

Either way it ends with this node's API key, which is what the other nodes need
to reach it. "Set this up later" skips straight to the UI.

The gear beside your name at the foot of the menu opens the account dialog:
change the password (optionally applying it to the other nodes), and choose
**Appearance** — *System*, *Light* or *Dark*. *System* follows the operating
system's own light/dark setting and changes with it. The choice is stored with
the node's administrator so it survives a new browser, and also remembered
locally so the page is painted in the right colours before it has asked the
server anything.

## In your language

The interface speaks the language your browser asks for. It reads the
browser's preference list the way any website does and uses the first entry
it has a dictionary for: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian,
Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian or Finnish. Nothing is stored
and nothing is asked -- change the language in the browser and the next page
load follows.

Everything the UI itself writes is translated: the menu, every page, every
form label and hint, dialogs, confirmations, the login screen, and the fixed
phrases the API answers with ("no such user", "the password is not correct").
What the node's own tools print stays as they print it: the output of
`haproxy -c` and `keepalived -t`, acme.sh logs, and any message the server
assembles around a value it is reporting.

A dictionary is one file, `static/js/i18n/<code>.js`, keyed by the English
string exactly as it appears in the source. `node tools/i18n-check.mjs`
extracts every string the UI can show and refuses a dictionary that is
missing one or drops a placeholder, and `tools/uitests/i18n.mjs` renders
every page and dialog in German and fails on any English left behind -- so
a string added to the source cannot quietly ship untranslated.

## On a phone

The same application, laid out for the screen it is on rather than shrunk to
fit it. Below 840px the menu becomes a drawer behind a button in the bar, which
stays put as the page scrolls; below 680px each row of a table becomes a block
with its column names in front of the values, dialogs take the whole screen,
and fields are large enough that a phone does not zoom in when you tap one.
In between, a table too wide for the screen scrolls inside its own card. The
page itself never scrolls sideways — a phone answers that by zooming the whole
interface out until the widest thing on it fits.

## Publishing a service

<img src="docs/img/services.png" alt="The Services page: each published name, the servers behind it, a day of traffic and the certificate serving it" width="900">

Each row is one public name routed to a pool. **Publish a service** opens the
wizard, which can start from a recipe:

<img src="docs/img/publish-wizard.png" alt="The publish wizard with the Jellyfin recipe chosen, filling in the port, health check and timeouts" width="900">

The normal way to use this is **Services → Publish a service**: give it the URL
people will visit and the server behind it.

```
Public URL    https://app.example.com
Forward to    http://192.168.1.100:1781
```

From those two lines it creates the Real Server, Backend Pool, host Condition,
routing Rule, the HTTPS listener, an ACME certificate, and an HTTP listener that
redirects to HTTPS — then applies. **Preview** shows exactly what it will create,
and the resulting `haproxy.cfg`, before anything is written.

The form is in sections — Service, Certificate, Health check, Balancing and
timeouts, Allowed networks, Rate limiting, Sign-in, Single sign-on — and each
optional section opens with a checkbox. Unticked, it is off, whatever its
fields still hold, so a limit typed and then unticked is not published.

- **Wildcard certificates are reused, not duplicated.** If a certificate already
  covers the host — `*.example.com` for `app.example.com`, or an exact name —
  the wizard attaches it instead of requesting another one, and says so before
  you commit. An exact name wins over a wildcard that would also match, and
  `*.example.com` correctly does **not** cover `example.com` or
  `a.b.example.com`. Set Certificate to *always request a new certificate* to
  override, or *no certificate* to terminate TLS elsewhere.
- **Several public URLs** on one service: put one per line and every name reaches
  the same servers, as a single rule (`use_backend be_app if acl_host-app or
  acl_host-www`). One certificate covers them all, and adding a name later
  extends it rather than requesting another. Names must agree on scheme and
  port, since they share a listener, and a URL with a path cannot be combined
  with others — a host and a path must both match, while several host names are
  alternatives.
- **Several targets**, comma separated, are load balanced across. Each may be
  named: `galera1=192.168.1.81:3306`.
- **Raw TCP** works too — give it `tcp://0.0.0.0:3306` as the public URL and the
  wizard builds a TCP listener, a TCP-mode pool and the servers. TCP carries no
  host name, so one port serves exactly one pool; publishing a port that is
  already taken is refused rather than silently merged. Load balancing,
  source-IP stickiness (a stick table), health check logging and a separate
  check port are all part of the same form, so this comes out of it:

  ```
  backend be_mariadb_galera_pool
      mode tcp
      balance source
      option mysql-check user haproxy post-41
      option log-health-checks
      stick-table type ip size 50k expire 30m
      stick on src
      server galera1 192.168.1.81:3306 check inter 3s port 3306
      server galera2 192.168.1.82:3306 check inter 3s port 3306
      server galera3 192.168.1.83:3306 check inter 3s port 3306
  ```

  Note `type ip`: that is how HAProxy spells an IPv4 stick table. `type ipv4`
  is rejected outright (`unknown type 'ipv4'`).
- **A health check** can be set up in the same step, and servers that fail it are
  taken out of rotation:

  | Check | What HAProxy does |
  |---|---|
  | ping | opens a TCP connection to the port (HAProxy has no ICMP ping) |
  | HTTP request | `option httpchk`, with a path and an expected status |
  | TLS handshake | `option ssl-hello-chk` |
  | PostgreSQL login | `option pgsql-check` — the login handshake only, no password |
  | MariaDB / MySQL login | `option mysql-check`, `post-41` for anything modern |

  The database checks expect the servers to speak that protocol, so point them
  at the database itself; the wizard says so when you pick one.
- **The check can use a different port and protocol from the traffic.** Set a
  **check port** and HAProxy checks each server at its own address on that port,
  which is how a PostgreSQL cluster behind Patroni is fronted: route TCP to 5432
  while an HTTP check asks each node's own API on 8008 whether it is the
  primary. The HTTP check can carry a method, an HTTP version and a Host header,
  and a pool can override the connect, server and check timeouts:

  ```
  backend be_postgres_backend
      mode tcp
      balance source
      option httpchk
      http-check send meth GET uri /master ver HTTP/2 hdr Host localhost
      http-check expect status 200
      timeout connect 5s
      timeout server 30s
      stick-table type ip size 50k expire 30m
      stick on src
      server postgresql1 192.168.1.111:5432 check inter 3000 port 8008
      server postgresql2 192.168.1.112:5432 check inter 3000 port 8008
      server postgresql3 192.168.1.113:5432 check inter 3000 port 8008
  ```
- **A path** works too: `https://app.example.com/api` routes only that prefix.
  More specific rules are placed ahead of broader ones, so a host+path rule is
  never swallowed by the host-only rule for the same name.
- **Publishing the same URL again edits it** — repointing a service replaces its
  target rather than quietly adding a second server behind it.
- **Editing changes a service, it never clones it.** Edit follows the service's
  own objects, so changing its URL, health check, balancing or targets updates
  the rule, pool, monitor and certificate it already has instead of leaving them
  behind beside a new set. New objects appear only where there was none before,
  and settings an edit does not mention are left alone. Objects shared with
  something else — a monitor another pool uses, an already-issued certificate —
  are never altered underneath it.
- **Overview** is the landing page and lists every configured service alongside
  node health, certificates and the generated configuration. **Services** shows
  the same table on its own. Delete removes the objects that mapping alone was
  using.
- **Pause** puts a service into maintenance mode: every request is answered
  with a clean 503 ("This service is down for maintenance"), while the servers
  and their health checks stay exactly as they were — pausing does not read as
  an outage, and Resume takes effect immediately instead of waiting for checks
  to pass again. The paused state is part of the shared configuration, so it
  survives a failover. It is also a switch on the pool's edit dialog, and —
  opted in — a switch in [Home Assistant](#home-assistant).

## Requiring a sign-in

A service can ask its visitors to prove who they are, two ways — and both
are enforced by HAProxy itself, so an unauthenticated request never reaches
the servers behind it:

- **Basic authentication** — a user name and password, checked from a
  `userlist` in the generated configuration. Users and groups are managed
  under **Sign-in**; a service admits groups rather than people, so access
  changes by moving someone in or out of a group. Passwords are stored only
  as SHA-512 crypt hashes, and a sign-in nobody can satisfy renders as
  `http-request deny` — refusing everyone is safer than quietly becoming
  public.
- **Single sign-on (OIDC)** — the service sends visitors through an OpenID
  Connect provider (Authentik, Keycloak, Authelia, Pocket ID, Google,
  Entra), with a per-service allow-list of emails and `@domains`. One
  sign-in covers every protected service; **HAProxy verifies the session on
  every request** in pure configuration — an HMAC-signed cookie, no Lua,
  HAProxy 2.4+ — so the app stays out of the traffic path and a failover
  signs nobody out. The upstream app sees none of the login unless a
  per-service toggle passes the *verified* identity as
  `X-Auth-Request-Email`/`Remote-User` for apps that trust a proxy identity.

Source-address controls compose with either: **Allowed networks** (a CIDR
allow-list, which works for `tcp://` services too) and **Skip the sign-in
from** (networks trusted without a password, typically the LAN).

A **rate limit** rounds this off. *Requests per client* on the service (or
the pool) refuses a client address that asks more than that many times in a
sliding window — HTTP with a 429, TCP by dropping the connection — until it
slows down. The counter lives in the pool's stick table, so it shares the one
table with source persistence when both are on; alone, 100 requests per 10 s
comes out as:

```
http-request track-sc0 src
http-request deny deny_status 429 if { sc_http_req_rate(0) gt 100 }
stick-table type ipv6 size 30k expire 30s store http_req_rate(10s)
```

The whole subject — the settings, the sign-in flow, provider setup, the
trust model, and what to do when something refuses — lives in
[docs/authentication.md](docs/authentication.md).

The **Advanced · HAProxy** menu group still exposes every object individually,
for the cases the wizard does not cover (header rewriting, custom ACLs,
per-object tuning). Every editor there carries a second tab, **haproxy.cfg**,
showing exactly what Apply will write for that object — recomputed from the
values as they stand in the form, not as they were saved, so an edit can be
read before it is committed. Raw lines the fields do not cover go in each
object's *Extra directives*; the file itself stays generated, because parsing
a hand-written haproxy.cfg back into objects would be guesswork dressed up as
a feature. The pages mirror the OPNsense plugins this UI was modeled on:

| This UI | OPNsense `net/haproxy` |
|---|---|
| Public Services | Virtual Services → Public Services (frontends) |
| Backend Pools | Virtual Services → Backend Pools |
| Real Servers | Real Servers → Servers |
| Conditions | Rules & Checks → Conditions (ACLs) |
| Rules | Rules & Checks → Rules (actions) |
| Health Monitors | Rules & Checks → Health Monitors |
| Settings | Settings → Global / Default / Statistics |

| This UI | OPNsense `security/acme-client` |
|---|---|
| Accounts | Accounts |
| Challenge Types | Challenge Types (HTTP-01 / DNS-01) |
| Certificates | Certificates |
| Settings | Settings |

(OPNsense's Automations have no equivalent here: what has to happen after a
renewal happens on its own.)

## How it works

- **All state lives in a single JSON file** (`$HAM_DATA_DIR/config.json`) — no
  database process, no schema, no migrations. The app is one Python process
  behind waitress; the only things running are it, HAProxy, and Keepalived.
  The generated `haproxy.cfg` and `keepalived.conf` are derived from that file
  and can be regenerated at any time, so the JSON is the single source of truth
  and the only thing worth backing up.
- **Timestamps are stored and sent in UTC, and shown in the browser's own
  timezone** — certificate expiries, snapshots, the watchdog's actions, log
  lines. The server has no idea where the reader is; the browser is the one
  thing that does.
- **Apply** renders `haproxy.cfg`, validates it with `haproxy -c` *before* writing
  anything, then writes the file (keeping a `.bak`) and reloads HAProxy. If
  Keepalived is enabled it renders and reloads `keepalived.conf` too.
- **Settings are checked before they are stored.** The settings pages have a
  **Validate** button that renders the configuration those values would produce
  and runs `haproxy -c` (and `keepalived -t` where it applies) without saving
  anything, and Save refuses outright if the result would not work — so a
  mistyped directive cannot be stored and then block every Apply until someone
  finds it. The full checker output is shown either way.
- **Only the node holding the virtual IP issues and renews.** HTTP-01 validation
  arrives at that address, so a passive node could not answer it, and with
  DNS-01 the nodes would race each other for the same certificate and burn the
  CA's rate limits. A passive node says so instead of trying, and refuses a
  manual Issue or *Renew all now*.
- **Everything a renewal needs happens by itself.** Once a certificate is
  written, HAProxy is reloaded so it actually serves it — it keeps certificates
  in memory, so a new file changes nothing until it reloads — and the PEM is
  pushed to every other node, so a failover serves the current certificate
  rather than the one that node last saw. There is nothing to configure.
- **ACME** issuance/renewal shells out to [`acme.sh`](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh).
  Certificates are written as combined `fullchain + key` PEMs into the HAProxy
  certificate directory (what HAProxy's `crt` expects). HAProxy is then reloaded
  and the certificate pushed to the other nodes, with nothing to configure. A
  built-in loop renews on the interval set in Settings → ACME Settings.
- **HTTP-01** challenges use a local `acme.sh --standalone` listener. When
  "HAProxy integration" is on, every HTTP Public Service automatically routes
  `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` to it, and HTTP→HTTPS redirects skip that path —
  so you can keep port 80 fronted by HAProxy and still validate.
- **Apply checks that HAProxy is actually serving afterwards.** `systemctl`
  returning success means the reload was accepted, not that HAProxy came back:
  a configuration that passes `haproxy -c` can still fail to start, because
  `-c` never binds a socket. So Apply asks HAProxy over its stats socket, and
  if it is not answering it puts the previous `haproxy.cfg` back, reloads
  again, and says so — loudly, and by notification. Without that a node can be
  left not listening at all, which looks like the node being down rather than
  like a configuration that was just applied.
- Before a real certificate exists, Apply drops in a short-lived **self-signed
  placeholder** so HAProxy can start; the first successful issue replaces it.
  It covers every name the certificate is for, and is replaced when those names
  change — a service answering for two names with a stand-in covering one of
  them serves the wrong certificate on the other.
- **Certificate status** is shown on Overview and under ACME → Certificates:
  whether the PEM on disk is a real certificate or still the placeholder, its
  issuer, its expiry date with the days remaining, and the outcome, timestamp
  and full `acme.sh` log of the last issue/renew attempt (the **Log** button).
- **The names on the record are not the names in the file.** Adding a name to a
  certificate does not reissue it, so until it is issued again that name is
  served whatever was issued before — which a browser reports as a failure to
  connect, not as a certificate problem. The names are read from the PEM
  itself, so the Certificates page says *not in the issued certificate* and
  names them, and the publish wizard says so at the moment it extends one.

## High availability

<img src="docs/img/cluster.png" alt="Cluster settings: virtual IPs, router ID, VRRP password, and what counts as HAProxy being up" width="900">

Any number of nodes. One holds the virtual IP and serves traffic; the others
stand by with the same configuration, ready to take it.

### Cluster health

**Overview** opens with a **Cluster** table: every node's role, HAProxy and
Keepalived state, which virtual IPs it currently holds, its certificate health,
its version and how long it took to answer. Each node asks the others directly,
in parallel, so the view is live rather than remembered.

It calls out the conditions that are otherwise invisible until traffic stops:

- **No node holds the virtual IP** — nothing is being served on it.
- **Two or more nodes hold it at once** — split brain; they are not seeing each
  other's VRRP.
- Nodes holding an **older configuration** than the rest — see below.
- Nodes with **unapplied changes**, nodes running **different versions**, and
  nodes that **did not answer** (with the reason: unreachable, or the API key
  this node holds for it was rejected).

### What is shared, and what is each node's own

The configuration has two containers, not one container with some objects
marked. The shared sections are what every node has. `local` is what only this
node has — and that includes whole objects, not just settings: the pool,
server, health monitor, rule, conditions and certificate that publish this
node's own management UI live there.

Sharing is therefore a copy rather than a filter: what is sent is the shared
sections as they are, and what is compared is the same value. Nothing has to
decide, on the way past, which objects belong to whom.

A listener is shared while the rule attaching this node's UI to it is not, so
`local.attach` records that by the listener's name — every node has one called
`https-443`, with a different id — and by position, since HAProxy takes the
first matching `use_backend` and serves the first certificate to clients that
send no SNI. Rendering merges the two.

### The nodes agree, or they do not

Reachable is not the same as up to date. A node that was unreachable when a
change was applied keeps the configuration it had, and until it takes the
virtual IP nothing about it looks wrong.

So the shared configuration — everything except node-local settings and the
objects a node owns alone — carries a **revision**: a counter that moves
whenever that configuration changes, and a fingerprint of its contents. Every
node reports both, the Cluster table shows them per node, and the header says
**configuration agreed** or **configuration differs** at a glance.

Three things follow from it:

- **A node that is behind is named**, with the revision it holds and the one
  the cluster is on.
- **A node cannot push a configuration older than the one already there.** An
  isolated node that was edited and then reconnected would otherwise overwrite
  the current configuration with its own; it is refused, with both revisions in
  the message. To discard what is on the other node instead, **Overwrite** on
  the Cluster page lifts this node's revision above every other node's and
  pushes, so they end up on the same configuration and the same revision.
- **It heals itself.** With *Keep the nodes in step* on, the background health
  check already asks every node how it is; any node reporting an older revision
  is brought up to date from the node holding the newest, and a node that has
  just started takes the newest configuration from the cluster before it can
  serve anything stale. Nothing is queued, so nothing is lost — the next round
  observes the same disagreement and acts on it again.

### The Cluster page

Everything about the cluster lives on one page, split by what it applies to:

- **Cluster settings** — the virtual IPs, virtual router ID, VRRP password,
  advertisement interval, initial state, `nopreempt` and HAProxy tracking. These
  must be identical everywhere, so they are part of the shared configuration and
  travel with a push.
- **This node** — whether Keepalived runs here, the interface, this node's
  priority, its unicast addresses, the URL the others should use to reach it, and
  its API key. Never synced: these are meant to differ.
- **Other nodes** — one entry per node with its URL and the API key configured
  *on that node*. A push also hands each node the membership list, including a
  way back to this one, so you maintain the list in one place. Keys are stored
  per peer and never sent back to the browser.
- **This node right now** — the diagnostics described under Keepalived below.

An existing two-node setup is migrated automatically: the old single peer becomes
the first entry, and the shared VRRP settings move out of the node-local section.

### Only the active node is editable

The node holding the virtual IP is where the shared configuration is edited; the
others are **read-only** and show a banner saying so. This stops nodes from
diverging and then overwriting each other on the next push.

A passive node can still fix **itself** — interface, priority, unicast addresses,
peer list, login, API key, updates, and Apply — because a node that cannot take
the VIP has to be repairable. And when *no* node holds the VIP, the banner's
**Edit here anyway** unlocks that node, so a broken cluster is never a lockout.
The lock is enforced by the API, not just hidden in the UI.

The unlock belongs to the sign-in that asked for it: **Lock again** restores it,
and so does signing out or back in. It is not stored, so it cannot be left on by
accident, and another browser signed in to the same node is unaffected.

### Keepalived

- **Keepalived** runs on every node that has a virtual IP configured — it is not
  a per-node switch, so a node cannot sit in a cluster with VRRP quietly off.
  **Unicast addresses are derived** from the node list: each node asks the
  others for the address on their VRRP interface, excluding the virtual IP,
  which is why a DNS name is never used for this. There is nothing to type.
- **Keepalived** runs VRRP on every node with a shared **virtual IP**. Bind your
  Public Services to that VIP. Keepalived's settings are **node-local** — set them
  separately on each node, and they must agree on the **virtual router ID**. For
  non-preempting failover set every node to `BACKUP` with a different priority
  and enable `nopreempt`; the highest-priority node holds the VIP, and a
  recovered node won't yank it back.
- **Tracking HAProxy** decides when a node should give the virtual IP up. The
  default asks HAProxy through its admin socket whether it is serving, so an
  instance that is running but wedged — accepting connections and answering
  none — hands the address to a node that works. The alternative, *process*,
  only checks that something called `haproxy` exists, which a hung one still
  does. The check is a small script written next to `keepalived.conf` by the
  same Apply that writes it, and where there is no admin socket to ask it falls
  back to looking for the process rather than failing a healthy node.
  The **Keepalived** page diagnoses this node: whether the configured interface
  exists, whether the config was written, the VRRP state, and the
  `keepalived -t` output. The state is read from the journal when it is there
  to read — only the journal distinguishes FAULT from BACKUP — and otherwise
  worked out from whether the node holds the virtual IP, with the page saying
  which.
- **Sync** is push-based: the node you edit pushes to the others. A renewed
  certificate is pushed automatically by the node that renewed it.

### Node-local vs. synced

| Synced between nodes | Node-local (never synced) |
|---|---|
| Real Servers, Backend Pools, Public Services | Keepalived (interface, VRID, priority, VIP) |
| Conditions, Rules, Health Monitors | The peer list and their API keys |
| HAProxy Settings | API key |
| ACME accounts, challenges, certificates, automations | Administrator login |
| Deployed certificate PEM files | |

## Reaching the UI over HTTPS

**Settings → Web UI access** publishes this management UI through HAProxy itself,
so it answers at a name you choose:

```
Serve the UI through HAProxy   [x]
Address                        https://proxy.example.com
```

It builds the same objects the publish wizard would — a pool pointing at
`127.0.0.1:8080`, a host rule, the HTTPS listener, an HTTP→HTTPS redirect and a
certificate — and reuses a wildcard that already covers the name. Turning it off
removes them again. A host name already used by another service is refused
rather than quietly stolen from it.

**Set it on each node, with that node's own name.** The setting and everything it
creates are node-local: they are stripped from what a node sends its peers and
preserved when a configuration arrives, so `proxy1` never turns up on the other
nodes. The service appears in the Services list marked as managed, with no Edit
or Delete — change it from this page, or turn it off.

Once it works, set `HAM_LISTEN=127.0.0.1` in the service unit and restart, so the
plain-HTTP port is no longer reachable from anywhere but HAProxy. The page says
so while the UI is still listening on all addresses.

## Requesting a certificate

<img src="docs/img/certificates.png" alt="The Certificates page: what is on disk, its issuer, expiry and days remaining" width="900">

**Certificates → Request a certificate** asks for the domains and then, for the
two things a certificate needs, lets you either reuse what is already there or
create it in the same step:

- **ACME account** — an existing one, or a new one with its e-mail and CA
  (`letsencrypt_test` issues untrusted certificates with no rate limits, which
  is what you want while setting things up).
- **Challenge type** — an existing one, or a new HTTP-01 or DNS-01.

**Preview** shows exactly which objects will be created or reused before
anything is saved, and *Request it now* runs `acme.sh` immediately and shows its
log. It warns about the mistakes that are otherwise only visible in a failed
issuance: a wildcard with an HTTP-01 challenge (only DNS-01 can validate one), a
DNS-01 challenge with no API hook, and an account with no e-mail address.

### DNS API hooks

The **DNS API hook** field lists every hook the `acme.sh` on this node actually
provides — 191 of them, by provider name — and picking one shows the credentials
it needs, with a button that fills the variable names into the credentials box:

```
CloudFlare needs:
  CF_Key    — API Key
  CF_Email  — Your account email
or instead:
  CF_Token  — API Token
  CF_Account_ID — Account ID
  CF_Zone_ID — Zone ID. Optional.
```

That list is parsed from acme.sh itself rather than hard-coded, so it stays
correct as acme.sh adds providers. The field still accepts anything typed, so an
unknown or newer hook name is passed through unchanged.

## Statistics

**Statistics** reads HAProxy's admin socket (`show stat`) and refreshes every
five seconds:

- **Listeners** — status, current/max/total sessions, request rate, bytes in and
  out, denied requests and errors.
- **Each pool** — its own status, how many servers are up, and per server: state
  (UP / DOWN / MAINT / DRAIN / NOLB) with how long it has held it, active or
  backup, weight, sessions, queue, traffic, the last health check result
  (`L7OK`, `L4CON`, …) with its duration, failed-check and flap counts, and
  total downtime.

A server with health checking switched off reports `no check` and counts as up,
because HAProxy still routes to it.

## Traffic history

<img src="docs/img/statistics.png" alt="The Traffic card: a day of requests per pool, with server errors drawn over them" width="900">

The Statistics page shows what is happening now; the **Traffic** card on it
shows what happened. Once a minute each node records, per pool, how many
requests it served and how many server errors it returned, and keeps a day of
it — enough to answer *when did this start*, which a live gauge cannot.

The Services page carries the same thing as a sparkline per service, with
server errors drawn over the requests, because the question is always whether
they happened at the same time.

It is per node and only covers time the app was running: a gap in the line is
a gap in the recording, not in the traffic. Counts are per minute rather than
totals, and a counter that goes backwards is treated as HAProxy having
restarted rather than as negative traffic.

**The traffic this app generates itself is not counted.** The once-a-minute
URL probes go through HAProxy on purpose — that is what makes them honest —
so HAProxy counts them like anyone else's requests, and a service nobody
visits would show a steady line of the app talking to itself. The history
subtracts what the probes put through, including the 401 a sign-in answers a
probe with, so zero visitors reads as zero. (HAProxy's backend *health
checks* were never in these numbers — HAProxy accounts for them separately.)

**The charts cannot overstate a trickle.** A sparkline scaled purely to its
own peak turns a flat 1 request a minute into a solid block that reads as
more traffic than a real rush on the row above it. The scale therefore never
drops below 10 requests a minute: a trickle draws as the low band it is, and
anything actually busy still gets its own scale. Server errors are drawn on
the same scale as the requests, for the same reason.

## Metrics for Prometheus

`GET /metrics` speaks the Prometheus exposition format: per-pool request and
error counters straight from HAProxy, servers up per pool, certificate expiry
timestamps (and whether the deployed file is still the self-signed stand-in),
the URL probes' verdicts, cluster agreement, and the watchdog's view of each
service. Everything is read from state the app already keeps, so a scrape
costs what a page load costs. Note the request counters are HAProxy's own and
include this app's URL probes — the subtraction only applies to the built-in
traffic history.

It requires the node's API key, because service names and certificate
expiries are not for whoever can reach the port:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: haproxy-manager
    authorization:
      credentials: <the API key from Cluster - This node>
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["proxy1:8080", "proxy2:8080", "proxy3:8080"]
```

Scrape every node: each answers for itself, and `ham_node_active` says which
one holds the virtual IP.

## Home Assistant

Point **Notifications → Home Assistant** at an MQTT broker and the entities
appear in Home Assistant by themselves — MQTT discovery, no YAML, no polling,
and nothing extra installed on either side. The **Test** button connects and
publishes before anything depends on the settings.

Each node publishes a small device of its own: whether it holds the virtual
IP, and whether its HAProxy is answering. The node that *is* serving also
publishes the cluster's view, as one shared device:

- a **problem sensor per service**, honouring that service's *Alert when*
  setting — a Patroni pool at 1 of 3 shows healthy here too
- a **connectivity sensor per published URL**, from the URL probes
- **days to expiry per certificate**, with its domains as attributes
- **configuration drift** and **nodes reachable**, when there is a cluster
- **requests per minute per service**, from the traffic history (with this
  app's own probes already subtracted)

On failover the new active node simply continues publishing the same topics,
so the entities carry on rather than duplicating per node.

The connection is held open for the sake of the **will**: the broker flips
this node's availability topic to `offline` the moment the process dies, and
Home Assistant greys the entities out — the one state a dead process cannot
report for itself, and the reason MQTT beats polling here.

**Allow control from Home Assistant** (off by default) adds a **maintenance
switch per service**: flipping it pauses the service with a clean 503, exactly
like Pause on the Services page, and flipping it back resumes. Leave it off
unless you want it — anyone who can publish to the broker holds this power
the moment it is on, so keep the broker behind credentials you trust.

No broker, or no wish for MQTT? The webhook destination under Notifications
posts JSON that a Home Assistant webhook trigger can consume directly — zero
code, though it only carries alerts, not entities.

## Notifications

**Notifications** sends when something needs a person. Nothing extra is
installed for any of it: the whole feature uses the standard library and the
`requests` package that is already there.

| Destination | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Email (SMTP)** | STARTTLS, SSL or plain; authentication optional |
| **Pushover** | severity maps to Pushover priority (quiet / normal / high) |
| **Webhook** | `POST {subject, message, severity, event, node, time}`, custom headers |

The webhook is the escape hatch: it posts JSON, so a few lines of script can
forward an alert to anything not listed above.

Test each destination from the page: it sends a real message, so it is proven
before it is needed.

### When a service loses its servers

HAProxy is already health-checking every server, and it is the thing actually
deciding where traffic goes — so that is what the alerts come from. A service
whose servers all fail their checks is reported as down, one that loses some
of them as degraded, naming the servers and what their last check said. When
it recovers, that is reported too.

**A paused service says nothing about its servers.** Pausing a service is
usually the prelude to taking its backend down and working on it, at which
point the servers fail their checks — so a paused service is left out of these
alerts entirely. When it is resumed and its servers pass again, the next round
picks up from wherever it left off.

**What losing a server means is the service's own business.** Not every pool
means the same thing by a failing check. A load-balanced pool losing one of
three is degraded — but a Patroni pool is *designed* to have exactly one
server passing, because the health check is what does the routing: "down to
1 of 3" is its healthy state, and alerting on it is crying wolf on every
round. So each service carries an **Alert when** setting, in the publish
wizard beside the health check:

- **a server is lost** (the default) — any failing server is a warning, a
  pool with none left is an error
- **no server is left** — only the outage is news; servers failing their
  checks is normal running. The right choice for leader-election pools, and
  what the Patroni recipes now set by themselves. Recovery is reported the
  moment one server passes again, worded for what it is — "serving again",
  not a false "all servers healthy".
- **never** — this service looks after itself

**Only the node holding the virtual IP says anything about services.** Every
node runs the same checks, so three nodes would send three copies of every
alert — and a passive node's view is not the one that matters: it is not
carrying the traffic, and a server it cannot reach may be perfectly reachable
from the node that is. Faults about a node *itself* — its HAProxy stopped, its
certificate could not be renewed — still come from that node, because nobody
else can see them.

### It alerts on changes, not on conditions

A recovery is always delivered, whatever the severity threshold says. Recovery
messages are informational and the threshold defaults to warning, so without
that exception someone would be told what broke and never that it came back —
which is worse than silence, because it leaves them believing it is still
broken. A recovery for something that was never reported is not sent.

The watchdog runs every twenty seconds. Anything that reported a *state* would
arrive thousands of times a week, so alerts fire on **transitions** and an
unresolved problem is repeated only every `repeat_hours` (6 by default) until it
clears. Six watchdog rounds against one dead service produce two messages — "was
restarted", then "is healthy again" — not six.

A service that loses its servers is held for a **grace period** — 30 seconds by
default, on Notifications — before it is reported, so a reboot or an update that
takes it down for a few seconds does not page anyone. The clock starts when it
first goes bad, and a service that recovers inside the window says nothing at
all: no down alert, so no recovery either. Set it to 0 to alert on the first
check. (This is separate from the config-drift alert below, which has its own
much longer wait.)

One alert waits deliberately: **the nodes holding different configurations**.
Saving a change makes the cluster disagree *by design* — the other nodes catch
up when Apply pushes to them — so the moment of divergence is nearly always
the middle of ordinary work. That alert is sent only once the disagreement has
stood for **30 minutes**, longer than an edit-then-Apply should take, and its
subject says how long — so the reader knows it is not the save they made a
minute ago. The Cluster page still shows the disagreement immediately; it is
only the email that waits.

What it can tell you about, each switchable:

- **Certificates** — issued, or failed with the reason
- **Watchdog** — a service restarted, beyond repair, or unrestartable because
  its configuration is broken (the message names the offending line)
- **Apply** — refused by validation, or HAProxy did not reload
- **Cluster** — a node stopped answering, came back, or split brain
- **Updates** — a new version is published

`min_severity` sets the floor: `error` for breakage only, `warning` to include
repairs, `info` to include recoveries and new versions.

Settings are **shared**, so configure them on one node and they propagate — each
node then alerts about its own troubles. Note that this means SMTP passwords and
Pushover tokens travel in the sync payload: run peer sync over HTTPS, or keep it
on a trusted network. Because every node watches every other one, a node that
vanishes is reported by each of its peers — which also tells you who lost sight
of it.

## Watchdog

<img src="docs/img/watchdog.png" alt="The Watchdog page: what it sees right now, and what it has restarted" width="900">

Each node supervises its own services. **Watchdog** shows what it sees and what
it has done.

The point is the distinction between *stopped* and *hung*. `systemctl is-active`
answers "is the process there", which a wedged process passes while serving
nothing — so each service gets a probe that makes it *do* something:

| Service | Liveness probe | Restarted when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **HAProxy** | `show info` on its stats socket | the service is stopped or failed, or it does not answer within 5s |
| **Keepalived** | the service is running when the cluster wants it | it is stopped or failed while this node should be running it |
| **This app** | a real HTTP request to its own listener | see below |

It restarts deliberately, not reflexively:

- **Never against a configuration that cannot work.** If `haproxy -c` rejects
  the file, restarting is a loop that hides the fault, so it stops and says
  which line is wrong.
- **Never a service you disabled.** A masked or disabled unit is taken as "leave
  this alone" — a node in maintenance stays in maintenance.
- **Never endlessly.** Three restarts per fifteen minutes by default; after that
  it stops and reports, so a failing service stays visible instead of flapping.
- Everything it does is logged, so the **Logs** page carries the history.

### The published URLs are asked, the way a browser would ask

Every check above looks at a piece: the health checks watch the backend
servers, the watchdog watches the processes, the VRRP tracking script watches
the admin socket. All of them can be green while `https://app.example.com`
answers nobody — DNS pointing at the wrong machine, another host claiming the
address, a listener that lost its certificate. So once a minute, the node
holding the virtual IP requests every published URL exactly as a visitor
would: resolve the name, connect, speak TLS, ask.

Three answers. *It answers* — any HTTP status counts, including the 401 of a
service behind a sign-in, and the 503 of a pool whose servers are down (that
one is already alerted on by the health checks, so the probe stays quiet
about it). *It answers but the certificate does not verify* — expired, the
wrong name, or an issuer this machine does not trust; a visitor would get a
warning page, so this is a warning here. *No answer at all* — including a
name DNS cannot resolve, which is reported as exactly that. TCP services are
a connection attempt to their port.

Failures show beside the URL on the Services page and go out as
notifications (the *service* event), with what failed and what the name
resolved to. Only changes are reported, and recovery closes the loop.
Turn it off under **Settings → Watchdog** if your names only resolve from
outside your network.

### Two machines using one address

Every few minutes the watchdog asks the network whether anything else answers
for the addresses this node holds — `arping -D`, which asks without claiming,
so a reply can only come from somebody else. If one does, the Watchdog page
says so and a notification goes out.

It is worth checking because it is invisible from every layer above the
network: the address is configured on this node, the socket is listening on
this node, and a client reaches whichever machine won the last ARP exchange.
The symptom is a node that answers from some places and not others, and comes
and goes for no visible reason — which looks like almost anything except two
machines claiming one address. A cluster that deliberately moves addresses
between machines is exactly where it happens.

Nothing here can fix it: one of the two has to stop using the address.

### Watching the app itself

A watchdog inside a process cannot restart that process, so systemd does it. The
unit sets `WatchdogSec=90`, and the app pings systemd **only when a real request
to its own listener succeeds**. That catches the failure that matters: every
worker thread blocked, process healthy, UI answering nothing. Pinging from a
timer would report health from inside a process that serves none.

Verified by stopping the process with `SIGSTOP` — `systemctl is-active` still
said `active`, and systemd restarted it on the deadline:

```
systemd[1]: haproxy-manager.service: Watchdog timeout (limit 1min 30s)!
systemd[1]: haproxy-manager.service: Failed with result 'watchdog'.
systemd[1]: haproxy-manager.service: Scheduled restart job, restart counter is at 1.
```

In Docker there is no systemd: supervisord restarts the app if it *exits*, and
the image's `HEALTHCHECK` reports whether the UI answers, but nothing restarts a
hung container unless your orchestrator acts on that health status.

### Node health is collected here too

The watchdog polls every node on a schedule and keeps the result, so the UI
reads a snapshot instead of asking each node while you wait. The Cluster panel
shows the snapshot's age and has a **Refresh** button for a live round. With one
unresponsive node: **5.1s** to collect, **3ms** to read.

`HAM_CLUSTER_POLL` (15s) sets the collection interval; `HAM_CLUSTER_MAX_AGE`
(60s) is the age beyond which a request collects it inline rather than show
something stale.

## Logs

<img src="docs/img/logs.png" alt="The Logs page: the UI, HAProxy, acme.sh and Keepalived merged into one timeline" width="900">

**Logs** merges four sources into one timeline, newest at the bottom:

| Source | Where it comes from |
| --- | --- |
| **Web UI** | this app's own log — sign-ins, every configuration change and who made it, apply results, certificate outcomes, sync results |
| **HAProxy** | `journalctl -u haproxy`, falling back to `/var/log/haproxy.log` or `/var/log/syslog` |
| **acme.sh** | acme.sh's own log, plus the recorded outcome of every issuance |
| **Keepalived** | `journalctl -u keepalived`, with the same fallback |

Tick the sources you want, filter by level, search the text, and choose how many
lines to keep. **Follow** re-reads every five seconds and stays pinned to the
bottom; untick it to scroll back without the view jumping. **Download** saves
exactly what you are looking at, filters and all, as plain text.

Timestamps are the node's own, and lines that carry none sort to the end rather
than to 1970. Requests are logged with the object's name but never the request
body, so passwords, API keys and DNS credentials do not reach the log.

The app writes its own log to `/var/lib/haproxy-manager/haproxy-manager.log`
(mode 0600, rotated at 4 MB, three kept) and to standard output, so
`journalctl -u haproxy-manager` shows the same lines.

In the Docker image there is no journal, so a small collector binds `/dev/log`
and tees it to both the container log and `/var/log/ham-syslog.log`, which is
what the viewer reads.

## Updates

The app carries a version (`VERSION`, starting at **1.0**) and asks GitHub for
the published one **once a day**. When a newer version exists, a chip appears in
the header and **Settings → Updates** offers a one-click update.

**The whole cluster from one node.** Where there are other nodes, Updates
offers *Update the other N nodes as well*, ticked by default — visiting each
node to press the same button is the thing worth avoiding. They are told
first, while the node you are on is still running to tell them, and each
restarts when its own update finishes. Every node runs the same installer
against the same source, so there is nothing to hand over, only the
instruction. A node that does not take it is named with the reason and stays
on the version it had; nothing retries it, because an update is something a
person started and the node that missed it is their decision to make. The
Cluster page shows the version each node ends up on, and warns when they are
not all the same.

The update runs `install.sh --update --yes` on the node under `systemd-run`, in
its own transient unit. That detail matters: as a child of the service it would
be killed halfway, because restarting `haproxy-manager.service` takes down
everything in that service's cgroup. Progress is streamed into
`/var/lib/haproxy-manager/update.log` and shown live in the UI; the page keeps
polling across the restart. Your configuration, certificates and login are kept,
and **HAProxy keeps serving traffic** — only the management UI restarts.

One-click update applies to the installer-managed (systemd) install. In a
container the button explains that you should pull a new image instead.

**Betas.** A change worth trying before it is released goes out as a beta: the
same code on the `beta` branch with a version like `1.95.0-beta.1`, its own
packages and image, and a release marked *pre-release* on GitHub. No node
offers it until *Also offer beta versions* is ticked under **Settings →
Updates**; from then on the daily check reads both branches and offers
whichever is newer, and a node on a beta takes the release when it comes
(`1.95.0` is newer than `1.95.0-beta.1`). Untick it and the beta stops being
offered at once. Updating the other nodes from a beta node moves them to the
same beta — the update carries its branch — so a cluster stays on one version
either way. `HAM_BETA_REF` names a different branch.

To publish a new version: bump `VERSION`, push, and every node offers it within
a day. The check asks the GitHub API rather than `raw.githubusercontent.com`,
because raw is behind a CDN that keeps serving the old file for up to five
minutes after a push — long enough for a check straight after a release to
report the previous version. Raw is the fallback if the API is unreachable or
rate limited. `HAM_VERSION_URL` / `HAM_INSTALL_URL` point the whole mechanism at
a fork or a private mirror.

> The update fetches a script over the network and runs it as root. It is pinned
> to the repository above, and reaching it already requires an administrator
> login — the same login that can run arbitrary commands through an ACME
> automation — but if you would rather not have that path at all, leave the
> button alone and update with `install.sh --update` over SSH.

### If a configuration change goes wrong

`config.json` is written by rename, so it is never half-written, and the
previous version is kept beside it as `config.json.bak`. `haproxy.cfg` and
`keepalived.conf` keep a `.bak` too, written before each Apply.

The management UI is served by the app itself on port 8080, not through
HAProxy, so **`http://<node-address>:8080` reaches it even when HAProxy is
misrouting** — which is the way back in if a published address stops
answering. To put HAProxy back the way it was:

```bash
cp /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg.bak /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
systemctl reload haproxy
```

If the UI's own service is what is broken, **Settings → Web UI access → Save**
rebuilds it from the stored setting — the pool, the rule, the conditions for
both its addresses and the certificate — and re-attaches it to the listener.
Set **Certificate** to request a new one if the listener has lost the one it
was serving: an HTTPS listener with no certificate fails validation, and Apply
refuses rather than writing it, which leaves the node showing unapplied changes
until it is put right. Apply names that case when it happens.

## Configuration history

<img src="docs/img/history.png" alt="The History page: every state the shared configuration has passed through, with what each change touched, a diff, and Restore" width="900">

**Settings → History** lists every state the shared configuration has passed
through on this node — the last 50, newest first, each entry saying what it
changed ("haproxy.backends: 1 added, 1 changed"). A snapshot is taken whenever
the shared configuration actually changes, including when a **peer pushes a
configuration over this node's** — that one deliberately does not count as a
change of this node's own, so counting revisions would miss it, and it is
precisely the case worth being able to undo.

**Diff vs now** names the objects that stand between then and now — added,
removed, or changed — the same way the Cluster page compares two nodes.
**Restore** puts a state back *as a new change*: it takes the next revision
rather than the old one, so the rest of the cluster sees it as the newest
configuration, which happens to have older contents. Nothing is applied or
synced until you press Apply, so the result can be reviewed first. Node-local
settings — Keepalived, the login, the API key — are untouched.

The snapshots live on each node's own disk (`history/` in the data
directory, mode 0600 like the configuration itself); each node remembers what
it saw.

## Backup & Export

**Settings → Backup & Export** covers two different jobs:

- **Generated files** — download the `haproxy.cfg` and `keepalived.conf` this
  configuration renders to, exactly as Apply would write them. Downloading
  changes nothing on the node.
- **Configuration backup** — a JSON file holding everything the UI manages
  (Real Servers, Backend Pools, Public Services, Conditions, Rules, Health
  Monitors, HAProxy Settings, every ACME object, and the users and groups a
  service can ask visitors to sign in with — without their passwords).
  Restoring replaces all of those and leaves node-local settings — Keepalived,
  Sync, the login, the API key — untouched, so the same file can seed a second
  node. A restored user keeps no password, and one already on the node keeps
  the one it has. Nothing is applied until you press **Apply**, so you can
  review the result first.

The backup deliberately contains **no secrets**: no API key, no login, no
private keys from the certificate directory, and no DNS-provider credentials,
EAB keys, or single sign-on client secret. Certificates move between nodes
over Sync, or are re-issued; a restore onto the same node fills the stripped
secrets back in from what is stored, and a restore elsewhere asks for them
again. That makes the file safe to keep off the node.

## Security

- **A second factor, if you want one.** The account dialog can require a
  six-digit code from an authenticator app at every sign-in — standard TOTP,
  which any app produces. Enrolment only completes once the phone proves it
  holds the secret, so an unscanned QR code can never lock the account, and
  eight single-use recovery codes are shown once at setup. The pushed
  administrator record carries the second factor too, so a failover node asks
  for the same code. Lost phone, no recovery codes: `app.py disable-2fa` on
  the node's own shell — deliberately physical, because whoever can run that
  already owns the machine. The QR code is drawn by a small vendored encoder,
  verified module-for-module against a reference implementation; no
  dependency was added.
- **Sign in with a username and password.** The installer creates the
  administrator and prints the generated password (also written to
  `/var/lib/haproxy-manager/admin-credentials.txt`, mode 0600); change it from
  the account dialog, behind the gear beside your name. Passwords are stored only as a PBKDF2-SHA256
  hash, the session is an HMAC-signed `HttpOnly` / `SameSite=Strict` cookie that
  expires after 12 hours, and repeated failures lock that address out briefly.
  The login is node-local — set it on each node.
- The **API key** (Cluster → *This node*) is for machines, not
  people: the peer must present it before it may push configuration here, and
  scripts can send it as `X-API-Key` instead of signing in.
- If no administrator exists yet, the UI asks you to create one on first visit.
  Until then only the calls that create it answer — everything else returns 401 —
  so a node waiting to be set up does not hand its configuration to whoever
  reaches it first.
- **Every API endpoint requires a session or the API key.** Of 87 routes exactly
  three answer without either: `/api/login`, `/api/whoami` (which
  unauthenticated returns nothing but whether an administrator exists), and
  `/api/setup`, which refuses once an administrator exists. This is verified by
  a test that walks every route and checks the rest refuse an anonymous caller.
  On a node with no administrator yet, `/api/setup/state` answers too, so the
  browser can tell it must offer the setup wizard; it returns 401 the moment an
  administrator exists.
  The sign-in page and its icons are served without a session too, because the
  page has to render before anyone can sign in; they come from a fixed list of
  filenames, not from the directory. The `/.ham-sso/` routes for single
  sign-on are public by design — they exist to authenticate strangers — but
  they answer only on the configured sign-in host, act only on
  HMAC-signed parameters, and HAProxy routes nothing else to them.
- **The administrator login is node-local, but it can be copied.** Each node
  stores its own; changing the password on one leaves the others as they were,
  which is a problem you tend to discover during a failover. The account dialog
  therefore offers **Apply to the other nodes** whenever there are any. What
  travels is the stored PBKDF2 salt and digest, over the peer channel,
  authenticated with the receiving node's API key — never the password, and
  never from a browser. If a node does not take it, the dialog says which one
  and why, and stays open: that node keeps the old login until you fix it.
- **Put the UI behind TLS** (or an SSH tunnel / reverse proxy). Over plain HTTP
  both the password and the session cookie cross the network in the clear.
- The service runs as **root** because it writes `/etc/haproxy`, `/etc/keepalived`
  and reloads services. Restrict who can reach port 8080.
- **Served by waitress**, a production WSGI server — deliberately as a single
  process with a thread pool. The app keeps state in process globals (the lock
  that makes configuration writes atomic, the failed-sign-in counters, the
  renewal timer), so running several worker *processes* would give each its own
  copy and let concurrent edits overwrite one another. Raise `HAM_THREADS` if
  you need more concurrency; do not put a multi-process server in front of it.
  If waitress is missing the app still starts, on the development server, and
  says so in the log.
- **Request bodies are capped** at 16 MB, and `config.json` — which holds the
  API key, session secret, peer keys and password hash — is written mode 0600.

## Install

Debian-based distributions (Debian 12/13, Ubuntu 22.04/24.04), on **every** node:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invite-networks/haproxy-manager/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

From a checkout, `sudo ./install.sh` installs those files instead of
downloading. If HAProxy Cluster Manager is already installed the same command detects
it and offers to **update**, **remove** (keeping `config.json` and
certificates), **purge** (removing those too), or cancel; piped from `curl`
with no terminal to ask on, it updates in place and says so.

It installs `haproxy`, `keepalived`, `python3-flask`, `python3-requests`,
`python3-waitress`, `openssl`, `socat` and `iproute2` from apt, a pinned
[`acme.sh`](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh) with no cron of its own
(the manager drives renewals), enables `net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind` so HAProxy
can bind a VIP this node does not hold, creates the administrator and API key,
and installs the systemd unit.

Nothing in HAProxy's configuration is touched until you press Apply. The first
Apply overwrites `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`, keeping a `.bak`.

## Docker

Multi-architecture images (**linux/amd64** and **linux/arm64**) are published to
the GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/avandeputte/haproxy-manager:latest   # or :1.46 to pin
docker compose up -d                                     # on every node
```

The image is all-in-one: the manager, HAProxy, Keepalived and `acme.sh` in one
container. There is no systemd inside a container, so `supervisord` runs the
processes and a small `systemctl` shim ([docker/systemctl](docker/systemctl))
translates the calls the app makes. HAProxy runs in master-worker mode and is
reloaded with `SIGUSR2`, so Apply does not drop established connections.

Host networking is the intended mode — Keepalived's VRRP and the virtual IP need
a real interface — and Keepalived needs `NET_ADMIN`, `NET_BROADCAST` and
`NET_RAW`. One container per node.

One thing a container cannot do: **restart a hung manager**. On a systemd host
`WatchdogSec` handles that; supervisord only restarts a process that exits. The
image's `HEALTHCHECK` reports it, but something has to act on that. For a
production cluster, the native install is the better fit.

networking modes, volumes, environment, health, logs, upgrading and limitations.

## If the UI feels slow

Almost always it is waiting on another node, not on itself. A cluster member
that is *hung* — accepting connections but not answering — is far worse than one
that is cleanly down, because a refused connection fails instantly while a hung
one has to time out.

| Knob | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HAM_PEER_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` | `3` | how long to wait for a node to accept a connection |
| `HAM_PEER_READ_TIMEOUT` | `5` | how long to wait for it to answer a health query |
| `HAM_PUSH_READ_TIMEOUT` | `90` | how long to wait for it to accept and apply a pushed configuration |
| `HAM_CLUSTER_POLL` | `15` | how often the watchdog collects every node's health in the background |
| `HAM_CLUSTER_MAX_AGE` | `60` | age at which a stale snapshot is collected inline instead |
| `HAM_THREADS` | `16` | waitress worker threads |

Two things worth knowing:

- **Address peers by IP, not by name.** DNS resolution happens *before* any of
  the timeouts above start counting, so a slow or unavailable resolver stalls a
  peer query for as long as `/etc/resolv.conf` allows. It is also the wrong
  dependency: the name may be published by the very cluster that is in trouble.

  DNS is **not** cached on a stock Debian or Ubuntu server unless something is
  installed to do it: `nsswitch.conf` says `hosts: files dns`, and glibc has no
  cache of its own, so every lookup goes to the network. The resolver defaults
  are `timeout:5 attempts:2`, so a nameserver that does not answer costs ten
  seconds per lookup, every time — and a failed lookup is precisely the thing
  nothing can cache.

  If you must use names, do one of these:

  ```bash
  # 1. put the cluster in /etc/hosts -- checked before DNS, always instant
  printf '10.0.0.1 proxy1\n10.0.0.2 proxy2\n' >> /etc/hosts

  # 2. or fail fast instead of hanging
  printf 'options timeout:1 attempts:1\n' >> /etc/resolv.conf

  # 3. or install a caching resolver, and check it is being used
  apt-get install -y systemd-resolved && resolvectl statistics
  ```

  The Cluster page marks any peer that is addressed by name.
- **Apply waits for the push.** With auto-sync on, Apply returns only once every
  peer has taken the configuration or timed out, so a wedged node can keep the
  button spinning for `HAM_PUSH_READ_TIMEOUT`. The rest of the UI stays
  responsive throughout; only that request is waiting.

Set them in the systemd unit (`systemctl edit haproxy-manager`):

```ini
[Service]
Environment=HAM_PEER_READ_TIMEOUT=3
Environment=HAM_THREADS=24
```

## Environment overrides

`HAM_DATA_DIR` · `HAM_CERT_DIR` · `HAM_HAPROXY_CFG` · `HAM_KEEPALIVED_CFG` ·
`HAM_ACME_HOME` · `HAM_ACME_SH` · `HAM_LISTEN` · `HAM_PORT` · `HAM_THREADS` ·
`HAM_LOG_FILE` · `HAM_DEBUG=1` (verbose logging) · `HAM_STATS_SOCK` ·
`HAM_PEER_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` · `HAM_PEER_READ_TIMEOUT` · `HAM_PUSH_READ_TIMEOUT` ·
`HAM_CLUSTER_POLL` · `HAM_CLUSTER_MAX_AGE` · `HAM_WATCHDOG_PROBE_TIMEOUT` ·
`HAM_WATCHDOG_SELF_TIMEOUT` ·
`HAM_VERSION_URL` · `HAM_INSTALL_URL` · `HAM_DRY_RUN=1` (skip `systemctl` calls,
for development).

The app also has a small maintenance CLI, used by the installer and the Docker
entrypoint so neither has to reimplement password hashing:

```bash
python3 app.py show-admin                      # print the configured username
printf '%s' "$PW" | python3 app.py set-admin admin -    # set the login (stdin)
```

## Note

This is a configuration front-end, not a fork of the OPNsense plugins — it borrows
their structure and workflow but generates plain `haproxy.cfg` / `keepalived.conf`
and drives `acme.sh` directly.
